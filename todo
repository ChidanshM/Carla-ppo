TODO:
- Run old reward functions again for comparison
- Try to train a model where we repeat the hard parts instead of resetting to start
- Measure length of track
- Do some analysis of putting noise on the horizon
  - Might have to fix loading logic
- Train VAE directly on semantic map of road and lane lines (no buildings)
  - Compare performance. Hypothesis: Should drive better as vae does not care about buildings
